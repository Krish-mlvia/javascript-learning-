const name = "krish"
const age = 21

//console.log(name + age + "hey").  //its outdated way of concatenating string and number

console.log(`hey there my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`);

//use ${} to insert the varibale in the string and use backticks `` tp create a template string in js

const gameName =new String("pubg")

console.log(gameName[0]); //we can access the string like an array and we can also use string methods on it because js will convert it to a primitive string and then apply the method on it and then convert it back to a string object

console.log(gameName.__proto__); 
console.log(gameName.length); //length is a property of string object and it will return the length of the string
console.log(gameName.toUpperCase()); //toUpperCase is a method of string object and it will return the string in uppercase
console.log(gameName.charAt(2)); //charAt is a method of string object and it will return the character at the specified index
console.log(gameName.indexOf("g")); //indexOf is a method of string object and it will return the index of the first occurrence of the specified character
console.log(gameName.slice(0,3)); //slice is a method of string object and it will return the part of the string between the specified start and end index
console.log(gameName.split("")); //split is a method of string object and it will return an array of the characters in the string
console.log(gameName.replace("g","G")); //replace is a method of string object and it will return a new string with the specified character replaced by the new character

//these are some of the string methods in js and there are many more string methods in js that you can use to manipulate strings in js
